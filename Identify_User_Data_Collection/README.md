# User Data Collection

A simple way to understand what information is being sent out of the device is using the app Lumen. The Luman app is developed by researchers at the International Computer Science Institute to obtain anonymized data flow. Using the Lumen app will allow a researcher to easily identify the kinds of data that is going out of a device.

## Usage
